# Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/),
a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth.

The `Goal of this project` is to `use SQL to analyze data from this database.`

The Factbook also contains demographic information.
Here are the descriptions for some of the columns in the Factbook:

* `name` — the name of the country.
* `area`— the country's total area (both land and water).
* `area_land` — the country's land area in square kilometers.
* `area_water` — the country's water area in square kilometers.
* `population` — the country's population.
* `population_growth` — the country's population growth as a percentage.
* `birth_rate` — the country's birth rate, or the number of births per year per 1,000 people.
* `death_rate` — the country's death rate, or the number of death per year per 1,000 people.
